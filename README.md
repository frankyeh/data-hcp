# Data

The Human Connectome Project (HCP) has tackled key aspects of this challenge by charting the neural pathways that underlie brain function and behavior, including high-quality neuroimaging data in over 1100 healthy young adults. 

Using greatly improved methods for data acquisition, analysis, and sharing, the HCP has provided the scientific community with data and discoveries that greatly enhance our understanding of human brain structure, function, and connectivity and their relationships to behavior. 

The ‘HCP-style’ neuroimaging approach is being applied to a new generation of studies, including the Lifespan HCP and Connectomes Related to Human Disease projects.
